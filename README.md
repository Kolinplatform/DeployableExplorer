# Waves Deployable Explorer
## Problem

Most projects created in the Waves platform don't have access to an easy way to track transactions performed with their own tokens. Neither users have an easy way to access general token statistics.

## Solution

An easy-to-deploy and personalize explorer has been designed to address this issue. It connects directly to the Waves API and Waves Nodes to provide real-time information. By simply specifying the assetID, the explorer can be customized to track specific tokens.

## X-Factor

The key advantage of this explorer is its easy customization. Anyone, including non-technical users, can access this service by changing the assetID. Moreover, project owners can deploy their personalized explorer with just one click.

## Why Smart Contracts and DLT?

In this case, smart contracts are not mandatory as the services are access-free and primarily designed to assist common users.

## New Features or MVP Description

The current version of the explorer is connected to the Waves Mainnet. However, it can be easily customized to work with the Waves Testnet as well.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

The explorer is ready to deploy and will be available for free to all current and new Waves platform users. It is intended to serve the Waves community indefinitely. You can access a working version of the explorer at https://kolinplatform.github.io/DeployableExplorer/.

## Rewards for Project Supporters

By supporting this project, you will be assisting all current and future users who join Waves. Your support demonstrates a strong commitment to project and token owners.

## Current Stage of the Project

The project is ready to launch, and the full code will be released to the community for them to update and use as they wish.
